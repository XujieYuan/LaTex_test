    `'News is information about current events. \LaTeX--
    This may be provided through many different media: 
    word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, 
    electronic communication, or through the testimony of 
    observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called 
    "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media. Common topics 
    for news reports include war, government, politics, education, 
    health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, 
    entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. 
    Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, 
    public health, and criminals, 
    have been dubbed news since ancient times. Technological and 
    social developments, often driven by government communication 
    and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news 
    can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of 
    news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper.
